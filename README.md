Green stories is an app in which you can read and post about climate events and environmental concerns. The navigation has three key elements, a home feed, profile tab, and our story. The home feed is a display of cards that other people posted that viewers can then see by clicking on it. Cards display view count, date of posting and user that has posted it as well as a liking feature. Users can click it to then view the whole story with an image carousel. Our story provides a detailed analysis of four regions: United States, Europe, India, and China. By utilising the choropleth maps of global CO2 emissions and population density, it allowed us to pinpoint those locations of high CO2 emission. It also allowed us to pinpoint from those four areas, if they are procuring that much CO2 because of high population density or because of overuse of fossil fields for less people. The profile tab allows the user to view their finished stories and edit their details.
